1. Explain the concept of Common Language Runtime (CLR) in the .NET Framework.

It is responsible for executing and managing .NET applications. It serves runtime environment.
- Execution of managed code, executes after program has been compiled into IL (MSIL, CIL) code. IL code is stored in dll or exe files.
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, CLR uses JIT to convert IL code into native machine code specific to OS, occurs dynamically at runtime
- Memory management, CLR includes Garbage Collector (GC) that automatically manages memory
- Exception handling, try-catch-finally
- Security
    * CAS (Code access security) - controls what code can do and what resources it can access
    * Roles based security - developers can assign specific roles and permission to suer groups.
    * Evidence-Based security - examines evidence such as the code's digital signature, its source, and the URL from which it was downloaded to determine the code's trustworthiness
    * Verification and Validation - verification techniques to ensure that IL code is type-safe and does not violate memory safety rules
    * Strong name signing - Assemblies can be signed with a strong name, which consists of a public key token and a digital signature. This makes it difficult for malicious parties to tamper with or replace assemblies.
    * Code access permission - Developers can specify their code's permission requirements in the application's configuration files
    * Assembly isolation - Assemblies loaded into the CLR run in isolated application domains, which provide process-level isolation.
    * Sandboxing - The CLR allows you to create sandboxed environments where code can run with restricted permissions. This is commonly used for hosting untrusted code, such as plugins, in a secure manner.
    * Running unmanaged code - unmanaged code can only access managed code through well-defined interop mechanisms, which are subject to security checks
    * Custom security policies - Administrators can define custom security policies based on the organization's specific security requirements
    * Security Transparency - developers should annotate their code with security attributes to explicitly declare their security intentions   
- CTS and metadata, interaction between different .NET languages, stores metadata about types, methods and other elements within assemblies enabling reflection.
- Assembly loading and versioning, ensures that the correct version of an assembly is use and resolves dependencies between assemblies
- Interoperability, integrate legacy code and external libraries written in C, C++ and COM components
- Language independent, C#, VB.NET, F#, C++/CLI, IronPython
- Debugging and profiling
